\begin{lem}
There is no proof of $A \rightarrow A$ in the \L ukasiewicz system that is less than 5 steps long.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
In order to prove that no such proof exists we will attempt to construct such a proof.
We will despite our best efforts fail to do so demonstrating the impossibility of the task.

We will start our proof at the end.
We know that the statement $A \rightarrow A$ must appear in the proof,
and that any steps after it are extraneous and can be removed.
Thus $A \rightarrow A$ must be the last step of the proof.

\begin{align*}
A \rightarrow A \\
\end{align*}

We also know that $A \rightarrow A$ does not fit the form of any of our axioms.
This means that we must have arrived at it from modus ponens.

\begin{align*}
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{align*}

Since we arrived at this from modus ponens we know that there must be earlier statements of the form $\phi$ and $\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$.
Since all statements are finite we also know that there is no $\phi$ such that

\begin{align*}
\phi = \phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)
\end{align*}

Thus the two statements must be separate.

\begin{gather*}
\phi \\
\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}

We can express $\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$ as a statement of L.S.1 if $\phi = A$,
however doing so would mean that our proof would need to include a proof of $A$.
Since $A$ clearly is independent of our axioms we know that the statement cannot be a reference to L.S.1.

If we try to write the same statement as L.S.2 we will find it impossible.

\begin{gather*}
\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) = (\psi \rightarrow (\chi \rightarrow \omega)) \rightarrow ((\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \omega)) \\
\phi = (\psi \rightarrow (\chi \rightarrow \omega)), A \rightarrow A = (\psi \rightarrow \chi) \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \omega) \\
\phi = (\psi \rightarrow (\chi \rightarrow \omega)), A = \psi \rightarrow \chi, A = \psi \rightarrow \omega \\
\end{gather*}

Since $A$ cannot be of the form $\psi \rightarrow \chi$ (nor the form $\psi \rightarrow \omega$) there is no instantiation of L.S.2 of the form $\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$.

If we set $\phi$ equal to $\neg A \rightarrow \neg A$ we will find that L.S.3 allows us to conclude our statement.

\begin{gather*}
\neg A \rightarrow \neg A \\
(\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \tag*{L.S.3} \\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}

Now using the same thought process as $A \rightarrow A$ we can show that $\neg A \rightarrow \neg A$ must be derived via modus ponens.
This gives us a proof of the form:

\begin{gather*}
\psi \\
\psi \rightarrow (\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \\
(\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \tag*{L.S.3} \\
\neg A \rightarrow \neg A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}

Now since we are looking for a proof with 4 steps we know that it must be the case that $\psi$ is equal to $(\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$, otherwise we would have 5 steps.

\begin{gather*}
((\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)) \rightarrow (\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \\
(\neg A \rightarrow \neg A) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \tag*{L.S.3} \\
\neg A \rightarrow \neg A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}

Now we need to check whether the first statement can be a instantiation of one of our axioms.
If we check we find that there are no values of $\phi$, $\psi$ and $\chi$ for which the our statement is an instantiation of any of the axioms.

Now we backtrace to the last descision we made.
We chose to represent $\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$ as L.S.3.
Since that arrived us at an incorrect conclusion we know that it cannot be the case that in a four step proof that step is introduced by L.S.3.
Since we have removed all of the axioms as possibilites to introduce $\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)$  we know that it is introduced by modus ponens.

\begin{gather*}
\phi \\
\psi \\
\psi \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)) \\
\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \tag*{MP} \\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}

Since we have 5 claims here we know that in order to reduce our proof to 4 steps we must have two of them that are equal.
It is clear that no statement containing $\phi$ can be equal to $\phi$ and the same goes for $\psi$.
We also know that if a statement $\chi$ that relies on a statement $\omega$, it must be the case that $\chi \neq \omega$ otherwise our proof would be circular.

Of the remaining statments that could be equal there is only one pair that has the same form.
This leaves us to say that $\phi = \psi$. 

\begin{gather*}
\phi \\
\phi \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A)) \\
\phi \rightarrow (A \rightarrow A) \tag*{MP} \\
A \rightarrow A \tag*{Modus Ponens}\\
\end{gather*}
\end{proof}
